# first time to try markdown
## let's see what we got
### so i have wrote three lines with diffrent size
> here goes a quote
* 1
* 2
* 3

[and here goes a link](www.baidu.com)

try *italic*
and the code
`print(hello,world)                                                                                                                                      
a = b + c`

why can not wrap line auto
because i start a list?
try again
1. one
2. two
3. three
